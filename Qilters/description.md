 # Qilters
 + A Widget application using Qt and C++ in which user can select an input image from the computer, select one of the filters, apply it and check, and then save to any folder. 
 + There are 18 filters right now.
 + I have used predefined fucntions from OpenCv and concept of look up tables and pseudo coloring method for the filters.
 ++ There are features in the GUI like error and warning messages when there is no input image and user hit the apply button, and when user wants to close the application window.
